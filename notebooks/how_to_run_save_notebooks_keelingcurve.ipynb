    "\n",
    "**The Keeling Curve Jupyter notebooks allow users to customize graphics and animations of graphics found on the Keeling Curve website [keelingcurve.ucsd.edu](keelingcurve.ucsd.edu).**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running and modifying the notebooks with Google Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebooks use Google Colaboratory (Google Colab) which is a service provided by Google that enables users to run Jupyter notebooks without any code installed on a local computer. Jupyter notebooks are files that use python code and that run in a browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Colab is a virtual environment containing many python code packages so that the user doesn't have to set up their own python environment if they ran it on a local computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once in Google Colab, each notebook can be run to generate graphics seen on the home page of the Keeling Curve website and generate animations of select graphics. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use the notebooks served on Google Colab, **you need to have a Google account and be logged into it**. Without being logged into a Google account, you can only view the notebook and not run it. \n",
    "\n",
    "To run the notebook, click on the top menu option Runtime and then click Run all.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may see the following warning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning: This notebook was not authored by Google\n",
    "This notebook is being loaded from GitHub. It may request access to your data stored with Google, or read data and credentials from other sessions. Please review the source code before executing this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then it has two links, 'Cancel' and 'Run Anyway'.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's Google's way of asking for permission to use the notebook and asking the user if they trust the notebook. A reason not to trust a notebook is if the notebook has code in it permitting access to their Google drive and they don't know the notebook creator. The Keeling Curve notebooks do not grant or access your Google Drive. Only if you want to save your notebook changes, will the notebook ask to use your Google drive, and you have complete control of that.\n",
