        "Matplotlib is plotting package that enables plots to display when run in a Jupyter code cell. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### Setup\n",
        "\n",
        "For matplotlib commands, the package is imported with the abbreviation 'plt' and then all functions follow with a dot '.' and the function name. The import command is\n",
        "\n",
        "    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
        "\n",
        "To display plots inside the notebook, the next line is needed and place it at the top of the notebook\n",
        "\n",
        "    %matplotlib\n",
        "    \n",
        "This command will make your plot outputs appear and be stored within the notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Plotting\n",
        "There are two attributes associated with a plot, the Figure and the axes. \n",
        "\n",
        "The Figure refers to the plot that is created. To create a plot, one way to plot and keep track of the plot (figure) to save later is to set a variable fig equal to the output of calling plt.Figure(), e.g. fig = plt.Figure(). The variable fig is referred to as a 'handle'. A handle is a way to keep track of the plot so that you can save it later.\n",
        "\n",
        "    fig = plt.Figure()\n",
        "    \n",
        "    x = [1,5]\n",
        "    y = [3,4]\n",
        "    \n",
        "    plt.plot(x,y)\n",
        "    \n",
        "    fig.savefig(filename)\n",
        "    \n",
        "The axes refers to the graphic settings of the plot. When a plot is created, use a variable to keep track of the axes, called a handle, so that configurations of the plot can be set to customize the graphic. As an example of getting an axes handle are the statements following where 'ax' is the axes handle and fig is the figure (plot) handle. To apply a function to the axes, such as creating a label for the axis or setting the limits of the plot, type the name of the axes handle, ax, followed by dot '.' and then the function name. Below is a function call to set the plot limits of the x axis from 0 to 5.\n",
        "\n",
        "    fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n",
        "    \n",

        "    \n",
        "    ax.set_xlim(0, 5)\n",
        "\n",
        "Notice that 'subplots' is used. In the previous discussion about figures, plt.Figure() creates a plot with no handle to configure the plot properties. To get an axes handle, you can either define it right away with fig, ax = plt.subplots() or use fig = plt.Figure() followed by ax = fig.add_subplot(111) where the 111 refers the figure size and position.\n",
        "\n",
        "The x and y axes have many configurations that can be set using functions on the axes handle. Some options include setting the limits of the plot, including labels for the x and y axis, and adding a title to the plot.\n",
        "\n",
        "Along with properties, the plot function is called using the axes handle. \n",
        "\n",
        "    ax.plot(x, y)\n",
        "    \n",
        "You can plot directly without using an axes handle, plt.plot(x, y), but then you won't be able to customize the plot. \n",
        "\n",
        "Another feature of matplotlib is to set font and linewidth information for all plots created so that the options are set once and not each time a plot is created. The property to do this is rcParams. To set the font family, type the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "    plt.rcParams.update({\n",
