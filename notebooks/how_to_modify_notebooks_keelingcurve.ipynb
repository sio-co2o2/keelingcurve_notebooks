    "Plot ticks can be modified in the number created, spacing, length and thickness and the tick numbers can be formatted with font properties and modified to change how close they are to the axes.\n",

    "\n",
    "**set_matplotlib_properties** sets axes line width, font properties, \n",
    "\n",
    "**set_plot_props** sets tick and label properties and axes limits\n",
    "\n",
    "**create_xtick_labels** Function used for some plots and it changes decimal dates into date text and changes the positions of tick labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**add_plot_title** Sets the placement of any plot titles of the plot and their font properties. Titles as function arguments can be blank strings and then they won't show up. The function can be modified to use only one title or more than two. In the function 'set_plot_props', the spacing above the axes bounds of the plot used to give space for any titles can be adjusted by changing the 'top' property. \n",
    "\n",
    "**add_inset_label** Sets the placement of text displayed within the plot axes bounds and sets their font properties.\n",

    "#### Plot axes\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify modify axes thickness and whether they appear on the plot. This is done by modifying rcParams in the **set_matplotlib_properties** function. As an example, to remove the top and right axis, add the following:\n",

    "#### Resolution and size of the graphic\n",

If you wanted to include it, of which these steps are not shown, one would have to modify the axes limits every time the function is called to creat an animation frame.
