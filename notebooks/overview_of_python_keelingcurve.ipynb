    "#### Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, keeping track of a series of numbers can either be done with a \"list\" or a \"NumPy array\". The NumPy array is better for math, and the list is good for basic use. The NumPy package is discussed below. A python list is a way of representing a collection of comma separated values inside a pair of square brackets '[]'. For example, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and ['one', 'two', 'three']. And a list can contain both numbers and strings at the same time. The first element is at index 0 since python starts at 0 instead of 1. To get the first element in a list, type the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "    variable = a_list[0]\n",
    "    \n",
    "where variable = 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a part of a list, use a colon ':' to separate contiguous indices. A bit tricky is that python does not include the last index when selecting it with a ':'. So the following code for a slice of a list results in one number in a list and not two. \n",
    "\n",
    "    a_value = a_list[2:3]\n",
    "    \n",
    "The variable a_value = [3]. The number 3 is at index = 2. Python list selections are thus [start_index: end_index] where the value at end_index is not included in the result. Notice that a list is returned when a colon ':' is used, and that a single value of 3 is returned if you type a_list[2]. \n",
    "\n",
    "    b_value = a_list[2]\n",

    "\n",
    "It's helpful to use names associated with numbers and strings. There are variables of course, but there are also dicts, short for dictionaries. A dict is represented with a pair of curly braces '{}' and is a collection of names (called keys) and their associated values. These values can be numbers, strings, lists, more dicts, etc. An example of a dict is:\n",
    "\n",

    "    b_dict = {'x': 5, 'y': 7}\n",

To represent this decision, the words 'if', 'else', and 'elif' are used. And to separate the decisions to be made, a colon ':' is added after the decision statement. For python to know what code is associated with an if statement, it is indented. Usually 4 spaces. For example:\n",

    "The [pandas package](https://pandas.pydata.org/) can be thought of as a python representaion of an Excel worksheet. Data is stored in rows and column cells with column headers. Data stored in a variable represented by a combination of columns and rows is referred to as a dataframe. This makes it easy to work with one column at a time or multiple.

The function read_csv 'reads' or extracts data from the file and stores it in a varaible. To avoid having functions with the same name conflicting with each other, the 'pd' part is used in front of the function name. You'll also notice the variable itself can call pandas functions by using a dot (.) and a function name after it. And example is \n",

A file with the extension '.csv' means the file is a text file containing values separated by commas. Each value separated by a comma in a row is placed in a \"column\", meaning you can think of it like a spreadsheet column. If there are header lines, the columns are named using them. To get all the data in this column as a variable, use the following code:\n",

    "The Figure refers to the plot that is created. To create a plot, one way to plot and keep track of the plot (figure) to save later is to set a variable fig equal to the output of calling plt.Figure(), e.g. fig = plt.Figure(). The variable fig is referred to as a 'handle'. A handle is a way to keep track of the plot so that you can save it later.\n",

    "The axes refers to the graphic settings of the plot. When a plot is created, use a variable to keep track of the axes, called a handle, so that configurations of the plot can be set to customize the graphic. As an example of getting an axes handle are the statements following where 'ax' is the axes handle and fig is the figure (plot) handle. To apply a function to the axes, such as creating a label for the axis or setting the limits of the plot, type the name of the axes handle, ax, followed by dot '.' and then the function name. Below is a function call to set the plot limits of the x axis from 0 to 5.\n",

To get an axes handle, you can either define it right away with fig, ax = plt.subplots() or use fig = plt.Figure() followed by ax = fig.add_subplot(111) where the 111 refers the figure size and position.\n",
